# Proseminar: Digital Tools for Classicists

At the 2018 AIA/SCS Annual Meeting in Boston, there was a day-long workshop entitled Ancient MakerSpaces ([#AncMakers](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AncMakers&src=typd "#AncMakers")), organized by Patrick Burns of ISAW ([@diyclassics](https://twitter.com/diyclassics "diyclassics")). The workshop was, as described by Pat in a tweet, "designed to introduce participants to and [get] them started with digital resources & methods in classics/archaeology/etc. as well as to showcase solid scholarship in this area."

There were a number of awesome tools and reading/learning environments showcased that day to which we wanted to bring your attention for use in your own pedagogy or scholarship. Some of these tools (Scaife, Hedera, QCrit) are not yet publicly available but will be soon; Ryan has contacted the folks responsible for each tool/environment (James Tauber of Eldarion, Inc.; Ivy Livingston of Harvard University; and the Department of Classics at UT AUstin) and gotten us access to sneak peeks. The other three (The Bridge, Pleaides/QGIS, and WIRE) are databases and resources available to use right now.

1. [The Bridge](http://bridge.haverford.edu "The Bridge")  
The Bridge generates vocabulary lists for numerous Latin and Greek texts and textbooks. You can set filters, like chapter or line numbers, and parameters to display along with the definitions, like how often a word appears, when it first appears, what part of speech it is, etc. The goal is to support a student's acquisition of necessary vocabulary by *bridging* what the student knows to what the student doesn't know.

2. [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org "Pleiades") and [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/ "QGIS")

3. Scaife Viewer / Perseus 5.0

4. [WIRE: Women in the Roman East Project](http://wireproject.org "WIRE")

5. Hedera

6. [Quantitative Criticism Lab](https://www.qcrit.org/home "Quantitative Criticism Lab") (University of Texas - Austin)
